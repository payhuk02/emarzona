## 🔧 Configuration

Test configuration is in `playwright.config.ts`:

- **Test Timeout**: 30s per test
- **Retries on CI**: 2
- **Screenshots**: On failure
- **Videos**: On failure
- **Trace**: On first retry

## 📝 Writing New Tests

### Example Test Structure

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('Feature Name', () => {
  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
    // Setup - login, navigate, etc.
  });

  test('should do something specific', async ({ page }) => {
    // Arrange
    await page.goto('/some-page');

    // Act
    await page.click('button');

    // Assert
    await expect(page.locator('text=Success')).toBeVisible();
  });
});
```

### Best Practices

1. **Use data-testid attributes** for stable selectors
2. **Wait for navigation** with `page.waitForURL()`
3. **Check visibility** before interacting with elements
4. **Use meaningful test names** that describe what is being tested
5. **Keep tests isolated** - each test should be independent
6. **Clean up after tests** - reset state when needed

## 🎯 CI/CD Integration

Tests run automatically on:

- Push to `main` or `develop` branches
- Pull requests to `main` or `develop`

GitHub Actions workflow: `.github/workflows/playwright.yml`

## 📈 Test Reports

After running tests:

```bash
# View HTML report
npx playwright show-report
```

Reports are also generated in CI and available as artifacts.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Tests timing out?

Increase timeout in `playwright.config.ts` or individual tests:

```typescript
test('slow test', async ({ page }) => {
  test.setTimeout(60000); // 60 seconds
});
```

### Elements not found?

Add explicit waits:

```typescript
await page.waitForSelector('[data-testid="element"]');
```

### Network issues?

Check if dev server is running:

```bash
npm run dev
```
